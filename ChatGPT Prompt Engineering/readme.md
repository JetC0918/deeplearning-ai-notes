# 🧠 Prompt Engineering for Developers – Notes

These are my personal notes and takeaways from the **Prompt Engineering for Developers** course by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI. This course helped me understand how to build better prompts when working with large language models like GPT-4.

## 📘 What I Learned

### ✅ Key Concepts
- **Prompting is a skill** that improves model outputs.
- You can use techniques like:
  - **Iterative Prompt Development**
  - **Summarizing**, **Inferring**, **Transforming**, **Expanding**
  - **Building Chatbots** with well-structured prompts and roles

### 🛠️ Practical Tips
- Be **clear** and **specific** in your prompts.
- **Iterate** on your prompts based on model feedback.
- Use **structure and formatting** to guide model behavior.
- Think like a developer: prompt design is an **engineering task**.

🧑‍🏫 **Principles for Effective Prompting**
* **Clarity is Essential:** Instructions provided to the LLM should be highly specific and unambiguous.
* **Context & Tone:** It is important to specify the desired focus, the intended output style (e.g., journalistic, technical, casual), and provide any necessary background context.
* **Helpful Analogy:** The course suggests instructing an LLM as one would direct a smart assistant who is new to a particular task—clear details are paramount for good performance.
* **"Time to Think":** This principle involves structuring prompts or sequences of prompts to allow the model to perform more complex reasoning by breaking tasks into simpler steps. (This concept is explored in more detail within the course).
