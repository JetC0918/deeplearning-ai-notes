# 🧠 Prompt Engineering for Developers – Notes

These are my personal notes and takeaways from the **Prompt Engineering for Developers** course by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI. This course helped me understand how to build better prompts when working with large language models like GPT-4.

## 📘 What I Learned

### ✅ Key Concepts
- **Prompting is a skill** that improves model outputs.
- You can use techniques like:
  - **Iterative Prompt Development**
  - **Summarizing**, **Inferring**, **Transforming**, **Expanding**
  - **Building Chatbots** with well-structured prompts and roles

### 🛠️ Practical Tips
- Be **clear** and **specific** in your prompts.
- **Iterate** on your prompts based on model feedback.
- Use **structure and formatting** to guide model behavior.
- Think like a developer: prompt design is an **engineering task**.
